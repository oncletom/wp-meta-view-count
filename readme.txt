Fast and easy way to count post and page views. Especially with WordPress cache enabled.


== Description ==

Remember when you actived W3 Total Cache or Hyper Cache? No way to keep an eye
on your visitors unless you load either a bloated plugin or a remote script.

Because I always keep an eye on performance and want to have smallest footprint possible, I created this plugin for my own purpose.
Enjoy the work!

You can follow the active development on the [Github project page](https://github.com/oncletom/wp-meta-view-count).
Patches, issues and ideas welcomed!
